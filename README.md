# Potato-Disease-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
The system classifies potato leaf infections into one of three categories: leaf Healthy, a leaf infected with early potato blight, or a leaf infected with potato blight Late potatoes.

The system was developed to classify the infection of potato leaves into one of three categories: a healthy leaf, a leaf infected with early potato blight, or a leaf infected with potato late blight.

The work was done on 2456 data collected from the com.Kaggle website

The CNN network was built from several layers, numbering 16 layers.

We used activation functions between the layers, which are of two types (relu) and (softmax). 

The training process took a time of 45 minutes, and the verification process was successful. 

Then we tested on new samples, where the classification rate of the designed network reached 99.2%, which is a high rate.
 
After that, work was done on linking the form using the FAST API, and then a website was created
Electronically using JS REACT and linking it to the API, where the application takes the image
From the farmers and the classification of the plant whether it is healthy or sick.
